# MNIST

Deep learning can be considered as a subset of Machine Learning where the model learns and improves on its own by examining computer algorithms.

Deep learning models can be visualized as a set of points each of which makes a decision based on the inputs to the node, very similar to the neurons present in the human brain. Thus these nodes are called artificial neurons and a network of such nodes is called a Neural Network. The layers in these networks can perform complex operations such as representation and abstraction that make sense of images, sound, and text.

Deep learning models are widely used to solve Computer Vision tasks and allow a computer to see and visualize as a human would. In this tutorial, we will learn the basic flow of a deep learning project and we will classify handwritten digits using the Keras Python API with TensorFlow as the backend.

## MNIST Dataset
The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. This dataset is considered to be the “hello world” dataset for Computer Vision.

It has a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples for handwritten digits with a fixed dimension of 28X28 pixels. The goal is to correctly identify digits and find ways to improve the performance of the model. I have used the Google Colab environment as it has a simple interface and does not require and environment set up.
